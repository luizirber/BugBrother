INTERFACE:
    - Put the menubar to work
    - Change the icons of the dialogs for something more intuitive
    - Disable VideoInput and TrackSimulator when doing the tracking
    - TRACK SIMULATOR (TIP: can borrow code from areas dialog)
        - Don't change directly the data. Changes generate new tracks.
    - Put more experiments in a project (currently handles only one)
    - Transfer all the callbacks to the glade file (Is it viable?)
    - DeviceManager: allow changes in the pipeline
        - Video Input: I'm not happy with the way it is working. Try to find a better solution
                       to the problem of putting a xvimagesink inside the program.
        - Need to handle errors in the pipeline
    - Better Save/Load dialogs
        - ALMOST: Default directory must be home (DONE in new_project)
        - BUG: Why it doesn't create the first folder?
        - New project window isn't working.
    - DONE: Strict order: only call another dialog if the previous one is defined
        RefImg -> Scale -> Insect Size
        RefImg -> Areas
    - DONE: Refactoring - put the dialogs-specific code in new classes (dialogs.py)
    - DONE: Put a slider in the ProjPropDiag to control the threshold
    - SCALE DIALOG:
        - If shape is a line, disable Y_axis
        - Must only calculate the scale if a shape was drawn
        - Forbid counting pixels when mouse leave the image
    - AREAS DIALOG:
        - ALMOST: Resize areas in Areas dialog (still need to look at ellipse code)
        - DONE: What is the best for drawing? make the center static at the start point and increase the size
        - DONE: Circle is a subtype of Ellipse, and Square is a subtype of Rectangle. Unify the classes and 
                put a key_press event (SHIFT) to determine is it must be "squarish" (square and circle)
        - DONE: why the image don't show when the mouse isn't moving?      
        - DONE: Remove the Circle button    
        - DONE: Implement the Remove button
        - DONE: Select the last appended area
        - Forbid areas with the same name
        - When an area is selected, redraw with a different color
        - Put focus in area name when dialog is shown    
        - use the arrow keys to move the image
        - Allow the user to change the name of an area
        - An area must be selected to allow "Set as Release Area" button to work.
        - FUTURE FEATURE: create a freeform shape, and allow the user to draw the track format. 
                Could be useful to the motion tracking, because you don't need to look at the parts
                of the arena that aren't accessible.
    - INSECT SIZE DIALOG
        - DONE: Use the scale to convert the value to pixels instead of a metric unit.
    - PROJECT PROPERTIES
        - Allow user to enter the name of the experiment.
    - VIDEOINPUT
        - Draw the track when tracking
	- Only draw the point where the insect is, don't draw the boxes (tracking area, i.e.)
    - VIDEO TRACKING
        - Put a small counter, with time and current X and Y coordinates.
        - Show the track, not the bounding boxes.
        

DEPLOYMENT:
    - Installation facility

AREAS:
    - line methods
    - Put a description attribute in areas, so the user can write down what the area represents

PROJECT:
    - Project contains N experiments: each experiment has his own properties. When the
      experiment is stopped, begin another experiment, with the same properties. Allow
      changes in these properties for the new experiment.
    - Save each experiment in a separated file, with three images: refimg+areas, refimg+tracks and refimg
      Inside the experiment save the point_list, the area_list and the track_list
    - XML, when possible. Nowadays is just a pickled object.
    - Implements the extra_properties attribute

EXPERIMENT:
    - verify the calculations, because of x_scale_ratio and y_scale_ratio
    - ALMOST: Generate reports in CSV format

VIDEOPROCESSORMODULE
    - add points to the list
    - when experiment is stopped, begin another experiment and reset the values (threshold, scale, etc.)
    - allow clicks in the image to change the point where the insect is
    - need some corrections with parameter bug_size, sometimes it don't catch the insect.

REPORT:
    - DONE: Use ponderate average? NO!
    - Put date in separate cell
    - Put all times in seconds
    - angular average deviation -> angular standard deviation
    - Resume: put a resume before the areas, resuming all the experiments
    - Allow extra variables in the report (put in Track Simulator)
    - In every division, verify if the divisor isn't ZERO!
