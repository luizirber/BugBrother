INTERFACE:
- Better Save/Load dialogs
    - Default directory must be ~
- Scale and Insect_Size dialogs
- DONE: Refactoring - put the dialogs-specific code in new classes (dialogs.py)
- AREAS DIALOG:
    - DONE: Resize areas in Areas dialog
    - DONE: What is the best for drawing? make the center static at the start point and increase the size
    - DONE: Circle is a subtype of Ellipse, and Square is a subtype of Rectangle. Unify the classes and 
      put a key_press event (SHIFT) to determine is it must be "squarish" (square and circle)
    - why the image don't show when the mouse isn't moving?      
    - use the arrow keys to move the image
- DONE: Put a slider in the ProjPropDiag to control the threshold
- Track simulator (TIP: can borrow code from areas dialog)
- Put more experiments in a project (currently handles only one)
- Transfer all the callbacks to the glade file
- DeviceManager: allow changes in the pipeline
- SCALE DIALOG:
    - If shape is a line, disable Y_axis
- INSECT SIZE DIALOG:
    - Everything XD

DEPLOYMENT:
- Installation facility

AREAS:
- line methods

EXPERIMENT:
- verify the calculations, because of x_scale_ratio and y_scale_ratio
