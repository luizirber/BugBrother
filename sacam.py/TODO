INTERFACE:
- Put the menubar to work
- Track simulator (TIP: can borrow code from areas dialog)
- Put more experiments in a project (currently handles only one)
- Transfer all the callbacks to the glade file (Is it viable?)
- DeviceManager: allow changes in the pipeline
- Better Save/Load dialogs
    - ALMOST: Default directory must be home (DONE in new_project)
    - BUG: Why it doesn't create the first folder?
- DONE: Strict order: only call another dialog if the previous one is defined
    RefImg -> Scale -> Insect Size
    RefImg -> Areas
- DONE: Refactoring - put the dialogs-specific code in new classes (dialogs.py)
- DONE: Put a slider in the ProjPropDiag to control the threshold
- SCALE DIALOG:
    - If shape is a line, disable Y_axis
    - Must only calculate the scale if a shape was drawn
- AREAS DIALOG:
    - ALMOST: Resize areas in Areas dialog (still need to look at ellipse code)
    - DONE: What is the best for drawing? make the center static at the start point and increase the size
    - DONE: Circle is a subtype of Ellipse, and Square is a subtype of Rectangle. Unify the classes and 
      put a key_press event (SHIFT) to determine is it must be "squarish" (square and circle)
    - DONE: why the image don't show when the mouse isn't moving?      
    - DONE: Remove the Circle button    
    - DONE: Implement the Remove button
    - use the arrow keys to move the image
    - Allow the user to change the name of an area
    - An area must be selected to allow "Set as Release Area" button to work.
    - FUTURE FEATURE: create a freeform shape, and allow the user to draw the track format. 
      Could be useful to the motion tracking, because you don't need to look at the parts
      of the arena that aren't accessible.
- INSECT SIZE DIALOG
    - DONE: Use the scale to convert the value to pixels instead of a metric unit.

DEPLOYMENT:
- Installation facility

AREAS:
- line methods

EXPERIMENT:
- verify the calculations, because of x_scale_ratio and y_scale_ratio
- Generate reports in CSV format
