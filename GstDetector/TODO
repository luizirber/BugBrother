- DONE: Reimplement Point as a GObject
- DONE: Discover how to add defined .h into the plugin. This way the drawing
  functions can be shared.
- Expose the colors of the track, box and mask as properties, so the user can
  define them.
- Preallocate the exact number of itens in filter->points.
- ALMOST: Add a speed property. Need to calculate how many pixels it becomes
          when divided by the framerate.
- FUTURE: allow YUV caps, it's quicker than RGB. Reference: videoflip element.
